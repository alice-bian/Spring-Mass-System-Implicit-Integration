# Spring Mass System (Implicit Integration and Collisions)

**Goal:** Use a spring-mass system to simulate with collision (brush) and compare the results when using different stiffness parameters (bunny).<br />
<br />

**Execution & Output**

Download the files and navigate to project repo and type the following in Terminal: <br />
./mass_spring 1    # for bunny case <br />
./mass_spring 2    # for brush case <br />
<br />
The output will be a sequence of .poly files, which can be directly visualized by Houdini. A demo of my render can be found below!<br />
<br />
